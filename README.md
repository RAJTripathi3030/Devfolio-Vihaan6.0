The problem statement for NurtureCulture website is that despite India's rich cultural heritage, there is a risk of losing it to modernization and globalization. Many traditional practices, arts, and crafts are disappearing, and the younger generations are losing touch with their cultural roots. This trend not only threatens the diversity and identity of Indian culture but also has a negative impact on the country's social and economic development.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to preserve and promote Indian culture, both for its intrinsic value and its potential contribution to the country's growth. The NurtureCulture website aims to address this problem by providing a platform to showcase and celebrate various aspects of Indian culture, from its cuisine and music to its art, literature, and history. The website will also serve as a resource for people interested in learning about and experiencing different aspects of Indian culture. By doing so, NurtureCulture hopes to inspire a sense of pride and appreciation for India's cultural heritage and encourage its continued growth and flourishing.
